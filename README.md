Fidget
======

The Fidget or “One Square-Inch Microcontroller” is a small, inexpensive microcontroller board 
and associated “shields” designed specifically to be easy and inexpensive to build for the average 
electronics hobbyist.  Based on the Atmel ATtiny85 and the Micronucleus bootloader, the device is somewhat 
compatible with the DigiStump Digispark and can use the same modified Arduino software found on their 
site.
